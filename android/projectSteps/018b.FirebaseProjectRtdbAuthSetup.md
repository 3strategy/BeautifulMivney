{: .box-note}
This lesson is based on the tested flow in video `CMvpeYQm5xo` and its local captions file `captions/captions.CMvpeYQm5xo.sbv`.

Goal of this lesson:

1. Connect the Android app to Firebase.
2. Create a Realtime Database.
3. Enable Firebase Authentication (Email/Password only).
4. End with a setup that can be switched to another shared backend by replacing `google-services.json` in a separate commit.

Important scope for this lesson:

- We do **not** enable Google OAuth provider here.
- We do **not** configure production security rules yet.
- We focus on a classroom-ready setup that works fast.

{: .box-success}
This is a **NO-CODE lesson**:
- No manual Java/Kotlin edits
- No manual XML edits
- No manual Gradle text editing
- Only Android Studio GUI actions and Firebase Console actions

## Prerequisites

- Start from the project state after step `018a3.LoginActivityFromGui.md` (or at least after `017DuplicateAndAddActivityToMenu.md`).
- Project builds and runs before Firebase setup.
- You are signed into Android Studio with a Google account.

## Classroom onboarding modes (decide before class)

### Mode A - Connect to teacher/shared backend first

- Teacher or student-lead prepares one Firebase project in advance.
- Students start by plugging in the provided `google-services.json`.
- This gives fast classroom start and immediate interoperability.
- Later, students can still create their own Firebase project as a separate exercise.

### Mode B - Each group creates its own shared backend in lesson

- Follow all lesson steps as written.
- Each group ends with one shared Firebase project.
- Inter-group switching remains possible via the separate JSON-switch commit.

---

## Step 1 - Open Firebase Assistant and start connection

In Android Studio:

1. Open `Tools` -> `Firebase`.
2. Select setup flow for `Authentication` first (as shown in video).
3. Choose the Java app path and click `Connect to Firebase`.

{: .box-note}
The video starts with Auth side first, then RTDB creation in console.

## Step 2 - Create Firebase project from Assistant flow

During `Connect to Firebase`:

1. Click `Create a Firebase project`.
2. Give the project a clear name.
3. Click `Continue`.
4. Disable Google Analytics for this lesson.
5. Click `Create project`.

Expected result:

- Android Studio shows the project as connected.

## Step 3 - Confirm Android-side artifacts

After connection, verify:

1. `google-services.json` exists in the app module.
2. Assistant status changes from not connected to connected.
3. Gradle sync completes successfully.

If sync fails, stop and fix this before moving on.

## Step 4 - Create Realtime Database in the same Firebase project

In Firebase console for the project you just created:

1. Open `Realtime Database`.
2. Click `Create database`.
3. Choose the region shown in the video (US region).
4. Start in `test mode`.

{: .box-warning}
Test mode is for classroom development only.

## Step 5 - Rules for classroom development

In RTDB Rules, keep classroom-open rules for this stage:

- `read: true`
- `write: true`

Publish rules.

{: .box-warning}
These rules are intentionally insecure and must not be used in production.
Security rules will be taught in a later step lesson.

## Step 6 - Add Authentication SDK changes from Assistant

Back in Android Studio Assistant:

1. Add Authentication dependency changes.
2. Click `Accept changes`.
3. Sync project.

Expected result:

- App compiles with Firebase Auth + RTDB SDK setup.
- All changes are assistant-generated; no hand-written code is required in this step.

## Step 7 - Enable Email/Password sign-in provider

If registration fails with "user create failed", check Firebase Console:

1. Go to `Authentication` -> `Sign-in method`.
2. Enable `Email/Password` provider.
3. Do not enable Google provider in this lesson.
4. Do not configure MFA in this lesson.
5. Save.

{: .box-note}
This is the key fix shown in the video after the first failed registration test.

## Step 8 - Validation checklist

Run app and verify:

1. Register succeeds.
2. Login succeeds.
3. Firebase Console -> Authentication shows created user.
4. Firebase Console -> RTDB shows activity/data for your app flow.

When all four pass, setup lesson is complete.

## Git Commit Strategy (Mandatory Split)

### Commit A - Firebase setup baseline

Include all setup work from this lesson:

- Assistant connection changes
- SDK/Gradle changes
- Added `google-services.json`
- Console setup validated (Auth + RTDB)

Commit message example:

`018b: connect app to Firebase, create RTDB, enable Email/Password auth`

### Commit B - Backend switch only (for another shared group)

If moving to another shared backend:

1. Replace only `google-services.json` (and only related config files if truly required).
2. Keep app code unchanged.
3. Re-sync and run smoke test.

Commit message example:

`018b: switch Firebase backend (group shared project)`

{: .box-success}
This split lets each group share one Firebase project while keeping app logic identical.

## Classroom Shared-Project Policy

Default policy for this course phase:

- One shared project per student lead (or per group).
- App data root remains `/tictac/...` in RTDB.
- Different groups can work in parallel by using different Firebase projects and switching `google-services.json` via Commit B.

## Out of Scope (next lessons)

- Google OAuth provider setup
- UID-based security rules
- `FBRef` utility design and usage (planned for `018c` or `018d`)
- Lobby and room lifecycle implementation
- Realtime subscriptions for board updates
